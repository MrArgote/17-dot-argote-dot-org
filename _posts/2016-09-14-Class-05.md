- Level 1:
  - Remix: You can use mostly the same words and phrases but you try to re-organize them to express your ideas differently.
- Level 2:
  - Paraphrase: In your own words, describe the piece.
- Level 3:
  - Break Down: Analyze, give an opinion, what do you like or dislike about the piece?
- Level 4:
  - Get Creative: Did the piece give you an idea? Be creative and share your idea.
