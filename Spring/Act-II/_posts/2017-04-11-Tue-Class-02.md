When writing about a movie, or book, it's common to format the title to make it look different.

---

One way is to make the title _italic_. You can do that on Slack by surrounding the title with an underscore on each side.

e.g.  
`_Your Name_` ---> _Your Name_  
I think _Your Name_ looks like a great movie.

---

You can also make text **bold** by surrounding it with asterisks.  
* <--- that is an asterisk.

e.g.  
`*Your Name*`---> __Your Name__  
The plot of __Your Name__ looks very interesting.

---

And if you want, you could make titles appear as both *bold* and _italic_.

e.g.  
`_*like this*_` --->  ***like this***.  
or  
`*_like this_*` --->  ___like this___.
